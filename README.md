# Glitchy Text

Helps you create glitching (changing and getting back to default) monospace text.

# Demo

Check the demo out at: <https://btk.github.io/glitchy-text/>

# Usage

Grab and insert glitch.js to your HTML page;

```html
<script src="glitch.js"></script>
```

Then add `.glitchy` class to a text element (an element that has only text in it.)

```html
<div class="glitchy">This is a sample Glitchy Text</div>
```

# Help

I'm planning on letting end user create an option object for every glitch that will have properties for the animation. Contributions and pull requests are welcome.
